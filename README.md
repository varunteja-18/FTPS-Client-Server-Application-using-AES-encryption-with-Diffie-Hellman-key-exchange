# FTPS Client-Server Application using AES encryption with Diffie Hellman key exchange
Computer-Networks-project
The project involves developing an FTPS client-server application that uses AES encryption for secure data transfer and Diffie-Hellman key exchange for secure key management. The server and client exchange keys, authenticate, and then handle file upload and download requests with encryption and decryption processes. The application is implemented in Java with a graphical user interface for ease of use.
